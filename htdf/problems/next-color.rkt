; 
; Suppose you are working on a program someone else wrote
; that simulates traffic. In the program there are traffic 
; lights and cars and streets and things like that. While
; reading the program you come across this function:
; 
; (define (next-color c)
;   (cond [(= c 0) 2]
;         [(= c 1) 0]
;         [(= c 2) 1]))
; 
; What does it do? The name is a hint, it seems to produce
; the "next color". But its hard to be sure. 
; 


; 
; Surely if the programmer had followed the HtDF recipe 
; this would be better wouldn't it? Suppose instead the   
; code looked like this.
; 
; ;; Natural -> Natural
; ;; produce next color of traffic light
; (check-expect (next-color 0) 2)
; (check-expect (next-color 1) 0)
; (check-expect (next-color 2) 1)
; 
; ;(define (next-color c) 0)  ;stub
; 
; ;(define (next-color c)     ;template
; ;  (... c))
; 
; (define (next-color c)
;   (cond [(= c 0) 2]
;         [(= c 1) 0]
;         [(= c 2) 1]))
; 
; That's a little better. At least it is now clear that
; the function does produce the next color. And the tests
; make it clear that the function is really supposed to
; produce 2 when it is called with 0. But what are the
; 0, 1 and 2 about? And what about calling the function
; with 3? The signature says that is OK, but the cond
; in the body will signal an error in that case.
