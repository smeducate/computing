; Problem 6
; 
; Find whether the given list is a palindrome
;     Example:
;     * (palindrome '(x a m a x))
;     #t
; 


;; List -> Boolean

;; Given a list returns true if the list is a palindrome, false otherwise

(check-expect (palindrome '(a b c d e f)) #f)
(check-expect (palindrome '(a)) #t)
(check-expect (palindrome '()) #t)
(check-expect (palindrome '(x a m a x)) #t)

(define (palindrome xs) #f)
